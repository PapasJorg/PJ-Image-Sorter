                             PJ Jewelry Image Sorter
PJ Jewelry Image Sorter is an AI-powered tool that automatically classifies jewelry images into categories such as rings, watches, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and more. It uses state-of-the-art vision models (like OpenAI's CLIP) to recognize objects in images and sort them into folders â€” fully automated, with no manual labeling required.

 Features

 Automatically organizes images into subfolders by category

Tailored for luxury jewelry items (including custom pieces)

 Simple interface using Google Colab

 Works directly with Google Drive

 Built on open-source foundations (Apache 2.0)

 Client-ready customization & branding support

 How It Works
Upload images to a Google Drive folder (e.g., MyDrive/ImageFolder)

Mount Drive in Google Colab

Choose a model (default: openai/clip-vit-base-patch32)
